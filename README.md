Hardware Needed
Emporia Vue 2  ~ $100
Raspberry Pi ~ $40


The first thing to do is to get a raspberry pi running with HomeAssistant on it. I followed this blog post(https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/) and very easily had this up and running in no time. 

Next, I had to install the Emporia Vue onto my circuit breaker. This was actually very easy and as long as you take your time doing so it is very safe. The emporia app on your phone walks you through how to do it and shows you all safety instructions, as well as will refer you to an electrician to help you get it installed if you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself!
Now that we have our devices setup we need to connect the Emporia Vue to the HomeAssistant application. To do this we follow the instructions from the website here. Next we go to HomeAssistant and search for the emporia vue integration. You login with the same credentials as your emporia vue app and it should connect right away!
